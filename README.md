# Purpose
King County Housing Prices have risen as the Seattle, WA area has become more popular. My partner and I were interested in the prospects of flipping houses in the area to make a profit, and buying with the intention of taking advantage of the market for renting.

# Structure
This repo answers the following questions:

Question 1: What attributes affect price the most?
Question 2: How to increase the price attributes
Question 3: What areas are best to buy in?
Question 4: Is King County a sellers market?
Question 5: Which month is best to sell in?

You can find the corresponding notebooks with the names set as "question 1", "question 2" ect...

#Future work

Create a larger dataset in order to gain more acurate insight
Investigate larger dataset to find up and coming neighborhoods
Look into pricing by school district and crime rate
Look into the cost to up a home by grade, and what the return would look like over time
